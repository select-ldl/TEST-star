"ma_description"="Moving averages(MA) smooth the price data to form a trend-following indicator. They do not predict price direction, but rather define the current direction with a lag. Moving averages lag because they are based on past prices. Despite this lag, moving averages help smooth price action and filter out the noise. They also form the building blocks for many other technical indicators and overlays, such as Bollinger Bands, MACD and the McClellan Oscillator. The two most popular types of moving averages are the Simple Moving Average (SMA) and the Exponential Moving Average (EMA). These moving averages can be used to identify the direction of the trend or define potential support and resistance levels. \n\nA simple moving average is formed by computing the average price of a security over a specific number of periods. Most moving averages are based on closing prices. A 5-day simple moving average is the five-day sum of closing prices divided by five. As its name implies, a moving average is an average that moves.";
"ema_description"="Exponential moving averages (EMAs) reduce the lag by applying more weight to recent prices. The weighting applied to the most recent price depends on the number of periods in the moving average. EMAs differ from simple moving averages in that a given day's EMA calculation depends on the EMA calculations for all the days prior to that day. You need far more than 10 days of data to calculate a reasonably accurate 10-day EMA.\n\nThere are three steps to calculate an exponential moving average (EMA). \n\nFirst, calculate the simple moving average for the initial EMA value. An exponential moving average (EMA) has to start somewhere, so a simple moving average is used as the previous period's EMA in the first calculation. \n\nSecond, calculate the weighted multiplier. \n\nThird, calculate the exponential moving average for each day between the initial EMA value and today, using the price, the multiplier and the previous period's EMA value. The formula below is for a 10-day EMA.";
"boll_description"="Bollinger Bands(BOLL) are volatility bands placed above and below a moving average. Volatility is based on the standard deviation, which changes as volatility increases or decreases. The bands automatically widen when volatility increases and narrow when volatility decreases. This dynamic nature of Bollinger Bands also means they can be used on different securities with the standard settings. For signals, Bollinger Bands can be used to identify M-Tops and W-Bottoms or to determine the strength of the trend.\n\nBollinger Bands consist of a middle band with two outer bands. The middle band is a simple moving average that is usually set at 20 periods. A simple moving average is used because the standard deviation formula also uses a simple moving average. The look-back period for the standard deviation is the same as for the simple moving average. The outer bands are usually set 2 standard deviations above and below the middle band.";
"sar_description"="Developed by Welles Wilder, the Parabolic SAR refers to a price-and-time-based trading system. Wilder called this the \"Parabolic Time/Price System.\" SAR indicator is used in the system. SAR stands for \"stop and reverse\", which is the actual indicator used in the system. SAR trails price as the trend extends over time. The indicator is below prices when prices are rising and above prices when prices are falling. In this regard, the indicator stops and reverses when the price trend reverses and breaks above or below the indicator. ";
"mavol_description"="Volume(MAVOL) is an indicator that shows the amount of volume for a particular price range, which is based on closing prices. By combining volume and closing prices, this indicator can be used to identify high-volume price ranges to mark support or resistance. Volume-by-Price calculations are based on the entire period displayed on the chart. Volume-by-Price on a five-month daily chart is based on the daily closing data of all five months. Volume-by-Price on a two-week 30-minute chart is based on two weeks of 30-minute closing data.";
"macd_description"="Moving Average Convergence/Divergence oscillator (MACD) is one of the simplest and most effective momentum indicators available. The MACD turns two trend-following indicators, moving averages, into a momentum oscillator by subtracting the longer moving average from the shorter moving average. As a result, the MACD offers the best of both worlds: trend following and momentum. The MACD fluctuates above and below the zero line as the moving averages converge, cross and diverge. Traders can look for signal line crossovers, centerline crossovers and divergences to generate signals. Because the MACD is unbounded, it is not particularly useful for identifying overbought and oversold levels.";
"kdj_description"="Developed by George C. Lane in the late 1950s, the Stochastic Oscillator is a momentum indicator that shows the location of a closing price relative to the high-low range over a set number of periods. According to an interview with Lane, the Stochastic Oscillator \"doesn't follow price, it doesn't follow volume or anything like that. It follows the speed or the momentum of price. As a rule, the momentum changes direction before price.\" As such, bullish and bearish divergences in the Stochastic Oscillator can be used to foreshadow reversals. This was the first, and most important, signal that Lane identified. Lane also used this oscillator to identify bull and bear set-ups to anticipate a future reversal. Because the Stochastic Oscillator is range bound, it is also useful for identifying overbought and oversold levels.";
"rsi_description"="Developed by J. Welles Wilder, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements. RSI oscillates between zero and 100. Traditionally, according to Wilder, it is considered overbought when RSI is above 70 and oversold when RSI is below 30. Signals can also be generated by looking for divergences, failure swings, and centerline crossovers. RSI can also be used to identify the general trend.";
"arbr_description"="ARBR indicator（buying and selling sentiment indicator) is divided into BR indicators and AR indicators .The former is the buying and selling intention indicator, while the latter is the buy ingest indicator. AR can be used alone, while BR must be used with AR. They are important indicators of the change in the balance of power between the long and short sides of the market.";
"dma_description"="The DMA indicator (Moving of Different Average) is a technical analysis of price trends based on the difference between two moving averages. It mainly determines the size of the current buy-to-sell energy and the trend of future price movements by calculating the difference between the two different moving averages of the two base periods.";
"emv_description"="The Ease of Movement Value Indicator(EMA) constitutes a complete cycle of stock price systems based on changes in volume and sentiment. Stock price systems are designed to reflect the movement of stock prices or indices in a single volatility indicator.";
"wr_description"="The Williams %R is used primarily to study the volatility of share prices and to determine the timing of buying and selling by analyzing peaks and troughs in the volatility of share prices. It uses oscillating points to reflect the market overbought and oversold phenomenon. it can predict the highs and lows of the period, show effective buying and selling signals, and be used to analyze the short-term market trend of technical indicators.";
"cr_description"="CR indicator is also called the intermediate will index. CR has many similarities with AR and BR, but has its own unique research function, which is to analyze the stock market long-short power contrast and grasp the timing of buying and selling stocks.
